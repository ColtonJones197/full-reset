This is a personal blog created using the following technologies:
 - Javascript
   - Gatsbyjs - allows clean and performant static site generation
   - Reactjs - included as part of gatsby
   - npm with babel but I will likely try to move this to vite soon
   - GraphQL also included with gatsby to fetch all static files
   - node.js
 - CSS libraries/tooling
   - SASS for cleanliness/syntactical sugar
   - Tailwindcss for some basic styling
   - Fontawesome
